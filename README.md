                          Welcome to the 40DaysChallenge of learning Solidity | Beginner level edition
                          
                          Day 1 of #40DaysChallenge journey of Learning Solidity.
                                      Basic Syntax of Solidity
• Pragma: In Solidity, Pragma is used to specify the version we are using to write the Smart Contract. 

• Smart Contract: is the code or tamper-proof program that we are writing with the logic of- if 'x' event is happens, then 'y'  
   action will be triggered.
   
• Contract: Contract is the keyword to initiate with the writing of a smart contract with open curly brackets- piece of code 
   and the closed curly brackets . Similar to 'class' in C++ or Java. Formally, it is a collection of code that resides at a specific 
   address on the Ethereumblockchain. 
   
• Semicolon is present at the end of a line which acts as a Full-stop to that line and prevents the code from getting 
   continued to the next line.
